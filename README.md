Customer Churn Prediction
Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! This project is designed to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave) using a neural network. The prediction is based on demographic and account-related data, with visualizations to help understand the reasons behind potential churn and offer strategies for retention.

Project Overview
This project utilizes a neural network model to predict the probability of customer churn. A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit allows users to input customer data, view predictions, and analyze results with interactive graphs and visual insights. The app not only predicts the churn probability but also provides possible reasons and retention strategies.

Key Features
Predicts customer churn probability based on various input parameters.
Provides possible reasons behind churn using analysis.
Recommends strategies to retain customers.
User-friendly interface with interactive features.
Visualization of churn data using matplotlib for better insights.
Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used to build and train the neural network model.
Streamlit: Web app framework for creating an interactive user interface.
Pandas: Data handling and manipulation.
Matplotlib: Data visualization library.
Scikit-learn: Preprocessing data for training the model.
